## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course, I used a variety of data structures to handle loading, sorting, and handling data. I used pseudocode and C++ to create these structures including a Vector, Linked List, Hashmap, and Binary Search Tree. In the final project (Project Two) I created a full solution from scratch to read and parse a CSV file with a structure of Courses and their prerequires and store all that inside a Binary Search Tree.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by first understanding what I needed to create, understanding the data structure itself, and then finally piecing them both together. Understanding data structures is important, because it lets a developer choose the best tool for a job. All data structures have benefits and trade-offs, and it is important to be aware of these when coding to create the best performance and experience.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

While encountering roadblocks, I often had to take a step back and refresh myself on what I was trying to do. This included referencing the textbook or online resources to help me understand the data structure. Additionally, I often made use of the Visual Studio debug tools to help me set breakpoints and explore why certain aspects behaved as they did.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This course has made me a better programmer by giving me a broader perspective on how certain fundamental things in programming work. For example, I have been using lists and hashmaps in programs for several years, but it wasn't until this course that I understand at a deep level how performance is affected by using these structures and why having O(n) access to a hashtable is much more affective than finding an item through a list.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

After working on this project and having the deeper understanding as described above, I think it is also important to balance this with readbility and maintainability. While there may be a data structure that performs the very best, it may not be practical to use. I found that a semi-complex data structure such as a Binary Search Tree allowed a lot greater performance than what I normally would have used, but it still didn't sacrifce developer experience like the most efficient data structure may have.
